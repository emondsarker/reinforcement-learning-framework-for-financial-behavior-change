## 🧠 AI Architecture

### Reinforcement Learning Framework

**State Space (S)**: Weekly financial health snapshot

- Account balance
- Total spending and income
- Spending by category (groceries, dining, entertainment, etc.)
- Transaction frequency
- Derived metrics (savings rate, spending velocity)

**Action Space (A)**: Discrete coaching actions

- `0`: Do Nothing
- `1`: Send Spending Alert
- `2`: Suggest Budget Adjustment
- `3`: Nudge to Save
- `4`: Positive Reinforcement

**Reward Function (R)**: Behavioral change incentives

- `+10`: Successful savings increase after nudge
- `+5`: Spending reduction after alert
- `-2`: Overall balance decrease
- Custom rewards for category-specific improvements

### Model Architecture

```python
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, action_dim)
        )
```

**Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)**: Prevents overestimation of unseen state-action pairs, ensuring safe recommendations based on historical data patterns.
