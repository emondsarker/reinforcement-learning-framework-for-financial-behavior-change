3. **Validation**: Assess model performance against baseline
4. **Model Saving**: Persist trained model to filesystem
5. **Version Creation**: Create database record for new model version
6. **Dataset Reset**: Reset training dataset counters

### Resource Management

- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal resource footprint
- **Error Resilient**: Graceful handling of training failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Performance Characteristics

### Training Performance

- **Job Queue**: <10ms job queuing time
- **Training Execution**: Varies by model type (10s to minutes)
- **Status Queries**: <5ms response time
- **Database Operations**: Optimized bulk operations

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: Efficient model loading and training
- **CPU**: Single-threaded training execution
- **Storage**: Automatic model file management

# Trigger recommendation model training
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/coaching/continuous-learning/trigger-training/recommendation" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"priority": 1}'

# Check training status
curl "http://localhost:8000/coaching/continuous-learning/training-status"

# Auto-trigger ready datasets
