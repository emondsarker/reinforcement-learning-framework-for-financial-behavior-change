# AI Coaching Feature - Remaining Tasks

## Current Status

‚úÖ **COMPLETED:**

- Frontend AI Coaching UI components (RecommendationCard, FinancialHealthScore)
- Frontend service layer with API integration
- TanStack Query hooks for data management
- Coaching page with full UI
- Navigation integration
- Dashboard integration with compact recommendation card
- TypeScript types and interfaces

## Issues Identified

### üîß **Backend API Mismatches**

The frontend is calling endpoints that don't exist or have different signatures:

1. **Feedback Endpoint Fixed** ‚úÖ

   - Frontend now correctly calls `/coaching/feedback` with proper parameters
   - Maps frontend feedback types to backend boolean format

2. **Financial State Endpoint Fixed** ‚úÖ

   - Frontend now calls `/coaching/financial-state` (was calling `/coaching/financial-health`)

3. **Missing History Endpoint** ‚ùå
   - Frontend calls `/coaching/history` but this doesn't exist in backend
   - Currently using mock data simulation

## üéØ **Remaining Tasks**

### **Task 1: Backend - Add Recommendation History Endpoint**

**Priority: High**
**File:** `backend/app/routers/coaching.py`

Add endpoint:

```python
@router.get("/history")
async def get_recommendation_history(
    limit: int = 20,
    offset: int = 0,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Implementation needed
```

**Requirements:**

- Store recommendation history in database
- Return paginated results with total count
- Include timestamps and recommendation details

### **Task 2: Backend - Improve Feedback Storage**

**Priority: Medium**
**File:** `backend/app/routers/coaching.py`

Current feedback endpoint just returns success but doesn't store data properly.

**Requirements:**

- Create database table for feedback storage
- Store feedback for model improvement
- Link feedback to specific recommendations

### **Task 3: Backend - Add Database Models**

**Priority: High**
**Files:**

- `backend/app/models/database.py`
- New migration files

**Requirements:**

- `RecommendationHistory` table
- `RecommendationFeedback` table
- Proper relationships with User table

### **Task 4: Frontend - Error Handling Improvements**

**Priority: Medium**
**Files:**

- `frontend/src/services/coachingService.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCoaching.ts`

**Requirements:**

- Better error handling for missing endpoints
- Graceful degradation when backend features aren't available
- User-friendly error messages

### **Task 5: Backend - Enhanced Analytics**

**Priority: Low**
**File:** `backend/app/routers/coaching.py`

**Requirements:**

- Real analytics endpoint (currently frontend simulates data)
- User engagement metrics
- Recommendation effectiveness tracking

### **Task 6: Testing**

**Priority: Medium**
**Files:**

- `backend/tests/test_coaching.py` (create)
- `frontend/src/components/coaching/*.test.tsx` (create)

**Requirements:**

- Unit tests for coaching components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user feedback flow

## üöÄ **Quick Wins**

### **Immediate Fix for Feedback (5 minutes)**

The feedback buttons should work now after the API fixes. Test by:

1. Go to `/coaching` page
2. Click "Helpful" or "Not Helpful" on a recommendation
3. Should show success toast and "Thank you for feedback" message

### **Immediate Fix for Financial Health (5 minutes)**

The financial health score should now load properly from the backend.

## üìã **Implementation Priority**

1. **HIGH:** Task 1 (History endpoint) - Most visible missing feature
2. **HIGH:** Task 3 (Database models) - Foundation for proper data storage
3. **MEDIUM:** Task 2 (Feedback storage) - Important for ML model improvement
4. **MEDIUM:** Task 4 (Error handling) - Better user experience
5. **LOW:** Task 5 (Analytics) - Nice to have
6. **MEDIUM:** Task 6 (Testing) - Important for production readiness

## üîç **Current Working Features**

- ‚úÖ AI recommendation display with confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Action type visualization with icons and colors
- ‚úÖ Financial health score calculation and display
- ‚úÖ Feedback submission (backend receives it)
- ‚úÖ Navigation between pages
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Loading states and basic error handling
- ‚úÖ Dashboard integration

## üö´ **Known Limitations**

- History shows mock data (no real backend storage)
- Feedback is received but not properly stored for ML improvement
- Analytics are simulated on frontend
- No persistence of recommendation history across sessions

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Test current functionality** - Verify feedback and financial health work
2. **Prioritize Task 1** - Add history endpoint for complete user experience
3. **Plan database schema** - Design tables for recommendation and feedback storage
4. **Implement incrementally** - Add one endpoint at a time with proper testing

---

**Note:** The AI Coaching frontend is functionally complete and ready for use. The remaining tasks are primarily backend enhancements to provide full data persistence and analytics capabilities.
